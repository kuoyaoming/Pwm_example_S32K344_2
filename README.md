# S32K344 RGB LED PWM Control Project

## Project Background
This project serves as a comprehensive test case for evaluating the capabilities of Cursor AI tool in embedded systems development. Starting with a basic LED blinking example, the goal was to explore how effectively Cursor AI could assist in progressively enhancing and optimizing embedded firmware code through iterative development cycles.

The experiment began with the simplest possible embedded project - blinking an LED - and challenged Cursor AI to continuously improve the implementation through multiple phases of development, ultimately achieving a sophisticated RGB color showcase system that demonstrates advanced PWM control, color space mathematics, and hardware optimization techniques.

## Project Overview
This project is based on the NXP S32K344 microcontroller, using the eMIOS PWM module to control a Cree® PLCC6 3-in-1 SMD LED (CLP6C-FKB) to achieve smooth RGB color transition effects. Through 11 distinct development phases, it has evolved from basic single-color LED blinking to a complete RGB color showcase system, demonstrating the power of AI-assisted iterative development.

    - Red: 100% (baseline)
    - Green: 85% (brightest, needs reduction)
    - Blue: 110% (dimmest, needs enhancement)
  - 128-step high-precision brightness control

### Phase 10: PWM Overflow Problem Resolution (v10.0)
**Critical Issue**: Black flickering at medium brightness levels
- **Root Cause**: Incorrect PWM period configuration
  - Wrong setting: PWM period 0x9000, but MAX_DUTY 0x8000
  - RGB values exceeding PWM period causing counter overflow
- **Solution**:
  - Corrected PWM period to standard 0x8000
  - Implemented three-layer safety protection mechanism
  - Removed problematic lookup table, switched to real-time calculation
  - Ensured all RGB values within safe range

### Phase 11: Focus on Color Showcase (v11.0 - Final Version)
